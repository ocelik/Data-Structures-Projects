Program 1 - Birthday Paradox > The birthday paradox says that the probability that two people in a room will have the same birthday is more than half, provided n, the number of people in the room, is more than 23. This property is not really a paradox, but many people find it surprising.

My C# program tests this paradox by a series of experiments on randomly generated birthdays, which test this paradox for n = 50, 100, 500, 1000 students in university (birthdays between 1995 and 1997).

Program 2 - It places students to university according to points of students and quota of universities.
